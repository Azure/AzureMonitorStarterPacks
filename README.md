# FastTrack for Azure - Monitoring Starter Packs (MonStar Packs)

## Objectives

- Minimize the initial ramp up required for customers, in multiple aspects of the Azure technologies to deploy basic monitoring.

- Minimize the need for the Customer tto determine the minimal monitoring items for a certain type of workload 

- Provide best practices out of the box on items that need monitoring for different workloads 

- Create a framework for collaboration that will make it easy to add new monitored technologies. 

For a detailed solution anatomy, please refer to [Solution Anatomy](./Docs/solution-anatomy.md)

## Pre-requisites and recommendations

- Azure Subscription - an Azure subscription to deploy the components
- A Management group structure with at least one management group. Most of the elements like policies and permissions need to be deployed at a management group level.

## Setup

The Main solution can be deployed by clicking the link below.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzureMonitorStarterPacks%2Fmain%2Fsetup%2FCustomSetup%2Fmonstar.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzureMonitorStarterPacks%2Fmain%2Fsetup%2FCustomSetup%2Fsetup.json)

## Starter Packs

Packs can also be deployed individually or all at the same time.

Review Packs documentation [here](./Packs/README.md).

## Grafana Dashboards

Each pack may have its own Grafana dashboard. The Grafana dashboards are deplyed along with each pack.
In order for the current user to have access to the Grafana environment, the user needs to be added to the Grafana Admins group. This can be done by running the following these instructions.

1. Navigate the recently deployed Grafana environment and click on Access Control (IAM) and click on Add role assignment.

2. Select the proper user or users. The process may take a few minutes to assign the proper permissions.

## Removing the solution

In order to remove the solution, you can run the following script. The script will remove all the resources created by the solution.

```powershell
./setup/cleanup/cleanup.ps1 -RG <Resource Group Name> -RemoveAll
```

Alternatively, you can select to remove specific components of the solution by using the following parameters:

- RemovePacks : Removes all the packs deployed by the solution
- RemoveAMAPolicySet : Removes the policy set deployed by the solution
- RemoveMainSolution : Removes the main solution deployed by the solution

Once completed, some resources will remain in the resource group. These resources are not removed by the script and need to be removed manually. The resources are:

- Storage Account
- Log Analytics Workspace

Note: The Azure Managed Grafana environment requires about 10 minutes to be removed. Once finished, the resource group can be removed.

Note 2: To completeley remove the Log Analytics workspace, use the -ForceDelete parameter. This will remove the workspace and all the data in it (ignoring the retention period).

Example:

```powershell
remove-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName <Resource Group> -Name <Workspace name> -ForceDelete -force
```
